The following files provide an interactive data visualization to identify the variety of bacteria in test subjects. The visualization contains:
* A bar chart of the top ten bacterial species in a volunteer’s navel, selecting only the most populous species.
* A bubble chart visualizing the relative frequency of all the bacterial species found in a particular volunteer’s navel.
* A complete demographic information panel for any selected individual.
